Asynchronous paralell HTTP requests for Marmalade Quick. Included APIs and LUA Bindings

Marmalade Quick offers a synchronous one-at-a-time HTTP library (uses LuaSocket). This library provides a simple API to download files asynchronically and in parallel. The current implementation downlaods files directly to a specified file URL locally, and notifies LUA through a Quick Event.
